#TESTING

If you follow the instructions in the INSTALL.md, then then the created files from the example test run will end up in this directory.

This file (testoutcss/README.md) is more or less just to help make sure the output directory gets created when the package is installed from packagist.

if there's any interest down the road, perhaps I will explain more elaborate test cases here.
